    MPEG Audio Layer I/II/III frame header

    There is no main file header in an MPEG audio file. An MPEG
    audio file is built up from a succession of smaller parts called
    frames. A frame is a datablock with its own header and audio
    information.

    In the case of Layer I or Layer II, frames are some totally
    independent items, so you can cut any part of MPEG file and play
    it correctly. The player will then play the music starting to
    the first plain valid frame founded. However, in the case of
    Layer III, frames are not always independant. Due to the possible
    use of the "byte reservoir", wich is a kind of buffer, frames
    are often dependent of each other. In the worst case, 9 frames
    may be needed before beeing able to decode one frame.

    When you want to read info about an MPEG audio file, it is usually
    enough to find the first frame, read its header and assume that
    the other frames are the same. But this is not always the case,
    as variable bitrate (VBR) files may be encountered. In a VBR
    file, the bitrate can be changed in each frame. It can be used,
    as an exemple to keep a constant sound quality during the whole
    file, by using more bits where the music need more to be
    encoded.

    The frame header is 32 bits (4 bytes) length. The first eleven
    bits (or first twelve bits in the case of the MPEG 2.5 extension) of
    a frame header are always set to 1 and are called "frame sync".

    Frames may have an optional CRC checksum. It is 16 bits long and, if
    it exists, follows the frame header. After the CRC comes the
    audio data. By re-calculating the CRC and comparing its value to
    the sored one, you can check if the frame has been altered during
    transmission of the bitstream.

    Here is a presentation of the frame header content. Characters A
    to M are used to indicate different fields. In the table below,
    you can see details about the content of each field.

                                                It is an extension used for very low bitrate files, allowing the
                                                use of lower sampling frequencies. If your decoder does not
                                                support this extension, it is recommended for you to use 12 bits
                                                for synchronization instead of 11 bits.

                                                "free" means free format. The free bitrate must remain constant,
                                                an must be lower than the maximum allowed bitrate. Decoders are
                                                not required to support decoding of free bitrate streams.
                                                
                                                "bad" means that the value is unallowed. 

                                                MPEG files may feature variable bitrate (VBR). Each frame may then
                                                be created with a different bitrate. It may be used in all layers.
                                                Layer III decoders must support this method.
                                                Layer I & II decoders may support it. 

                                                For Layer II there are some combinations of bitrate and mode

                                                and some of 417 bytes long frames to get the exact 128k bitrate.
                                                For Layer I slot is 32 bits long, for Layer II and Layer III slot is 8 bits long.

                                                    10 - Dual channel (2 mono channels)
                                                    11 - Single channel (Mono)
                                                    
                                                Note: Dual channel files are made of two independant mono channel.
                                                Each one uses exactly half the bitrate of the file. Most decoders
                                                output them as stereo, but it might not always be the case.
                                                One example of use would be some speech in two different languages
                                                carried in the same bitstream, and then an appropriate decoder would
                                                decode only the choosen language. 
    
      J         2                (5,4)          Mode extension (Only used in Joint stereo) 
    
                                                Mode extension is used to join informations that are of no use
                                                for stereo effect, thus reducing needed bits. These bits are dynamically
                                                determined by an encoder in Joint stereo mode, and Joint Stereo can be
                                                changed from one frame to another, or even switched on or off. 
                                                    
                                                Complete frequency range of MPEG file is divided in subbands.
                                                There are 32 subbands. For Layer I & II these two bits determine
                                                frequency range (bands) where intensity stereo is applied.
                                                For Layer III these two bits determine which type of joint stereo
                                                is used (intensity stereo or m/s stereo).
                                                Frequency range is determined within decompression algorithm.

                                                after a Dolby-like noise supression. It is rarely used.
