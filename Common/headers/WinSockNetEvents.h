/*************************************************************************

This file contains the Frontier NetEvents interface for the Windows
version.  It uses the WinSock 1.1 specification.  Extensions should be 
added for the 2.0 specification at a later date.  The primary advantage
of the 2.x specification is that more then just the TCP/IP protocol is
supported.  In fact many protocols are supported including the Apple
Share protocol.


Created 7/20/97 Robert Bierman

  General Note:  All addresses are in HOST format.  We convert to network
  format internally.
