/*
DW 3/20/90:

this file isolates the declarations of the language's verbs.  an earlier version 
had these declarations in lang.h.  but about 30 files include lang.h, so adding
a new verb required all of these to be recompiled.  too bad only two files really
care about the token value -- lang.c and langvalue.c.

so we split the declaration of tyfunctype off into this file.  makes it possible
to add verbs when there's nothing to do in the kitchen or the yard!
